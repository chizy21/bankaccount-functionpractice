# JOIN METHOD

The **join()** method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.

```JS
const elements = ['Fire', 'Air', 'Water'];
const newString = elements.join(', ');
// expected value: 'Fire, Air, Water'
```

For this exercise we want you to build a joinToString() function that solves the same task with **for loops ONLY**.

A joinToString() function should
* Take an array and a symbol to be added between array item in the new string as arguments (2)
* Return a string value of concatenated array items separated by the symbol(symbols).
